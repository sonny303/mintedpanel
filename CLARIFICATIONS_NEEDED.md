## [e0.0] "No login" locked decision vs Supabase RLS — OPEN (2026-07-08)

- **Issue:** E0.0 locks "No login, no login roles, no default landing … no auth
  ceremony," but every data read/write runs through org-scoped RLS, which
  requires an authenticated Supabase session. Login cannot be literally removed
  without replacing the data layer.
- **Impact:** None if the intended meaning is UX-level; blocks nothing today.
  Build proceeds on the default below.
- **Options:** (a) DEFAULT, assumed: keep the existing session bootstrap
  (`/login`, persisted session) beneath the shell; the redesigned UX simply has
  no login ceremony, role gates, or landing gate. (b) Literal removal — would
  require a shared anon/service data path, a major architecture change out of
  Stage 0 scope.
- **Decision:** pending PM confirmation of option (a).
